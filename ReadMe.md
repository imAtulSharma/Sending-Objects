# Sending objects

I have made an application to send custom object through intents.<br>
Download [APK](https://github.com/imAtulSharma/Sending-Objects/releases/download/v1.0/app-debug.apk) for the application.

## What new I have learned in this?

- Sending custom objects through intents

- up back button navigation in an application

- make a activity reusable using single instance

- limiting the input text and type of the input data

## Previews of the application
